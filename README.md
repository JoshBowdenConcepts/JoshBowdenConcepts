# About Me

👋&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I’m @JoshBowdenConcepts<br/>
👀&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m interested in developing design systems with a focus on web accessibility<br/>
🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m currently learning more about web accessibility to better support my company<br/>
💞️&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds like fun!

## My Processing Style
I am a <strong>[Visual, Conceptual, and Kinethetic]</strong> learner

### What does that mean?

👁️ Visual - You need to see something visually to process and understand.<br/>
💡 Conceptual - You need a global understanding with all the pieces clear.<br/>
💃🏻 Kinesthetic - Moving your body helps you focus and work best.
